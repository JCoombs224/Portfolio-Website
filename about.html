                <p>
                    California State University San Marcos Computer Science Undergrad with a
                     life-long passion for computer hardware and software. Previous to CSUSM,
                     I completed an Associates Degree in Computer Science and Liberal Arts
                     with a focus in Mathematics and Science.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am currently ready and very eager to begin my career in the software/IT
                     field as a full-stack developer. I have experience in a wide range of
                     programming languages, including Java, C++, Python, C#, Javascript, CSS
                     and have even created my own language for a University project. 
                    Check out the home page a list of many of the projects I have done.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unofficially, however, my tech career had started at the age of 10 when I
                     became the family IT guy, being the only one who knew how to fix the internet
                     by unplugging and replugging in the modem. By the age of 12, I was already
                     building my first PC with cheap eBay second-hand parts that I would purchase
                     with the Christmas and Birthday money I had saved. My programming experience
                     began at the same time I had built my first PC when I wanted to learn how I
                     could make my own game mods for my favorite game at the time, Minecraft. I
                     learned the basics of Java at age 12 just by teaching myself from YouTube
                     tutorials and doing my own experimenting. This leads me to where I am today,
                     soon to have a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science.
